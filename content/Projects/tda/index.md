## Product Development Details

### Key Users

We have three key users:

**1. Account Manager:** Each account manager is responsible for a specific media account management (either Facebook, Google, Yahoo or LINE) and hold 10-30+ client accounts depends on budget and complexity. Account manager needs to deliver weekly, monthly and post-buy ad reporting, performance analysis and optimization suggestion to clients or sales managers.

**2. Sales Manager:** Each sales manager is responsible for multiple clients. In some key clients' cases, sales managers would take responsibility to provide integrated media buy performance review and optimization suggestion to their clients.

**3. Clients:** Clients are advertisers who be charged of commission fee for ad account management, performance report and optimization.

### User Interview/Survey

_I used to be an account manager at media agency in my early career, and transfered to an in-house marketing analyst role, so I deeply understand user pain points and service gap between agency and advertiser._

_But I could only speak up for my own experience, I still interviewed key stakeholders and made survey to get insight on current reporting workflow and service for further MVP planning._

**1. Account Manager:**

- I usually take the whole monday to deal with 15+ weekly reports manually, it's too overwhelming.
- I need to focus on ad account management, performance review and ad optimization. It is redundant to do the work of pulling data out from media accounts, clean data and make pivot tables in Excel.
- Sometimes, my clients or sales manager would have ad-hoc reporting requests but I already prioritize my tasks of the day.

**2. Sales Manager:**

- I need to collect media reports from different account managers to make integrated media buy report for my key clients, it's not efficient.
- I find the reporting is lack of visualization to highlight the performance. Therefore, it's time-consuming to interpret data into insightful story for clients.

**3. Clients:**

- **Integrated Marketing Service Clients:**
  Media buy efficiency is my top priority to evaluate a media agency performance. I know that a holistic media performance reporting and analysis is time-consuming, especially with Google Analytics metrics. I need ad performance review across all media and aligns with Google Analytics metrics to make budget allocation and creative-wise optimization, that is the key to increase ROAS and boost my business growth.
- **Non integrated Marketing Service Clients:**
  My sales representive let different account managers email me the media report directly, and I could discuss media performance, strategy and optimization with each account manager. However, I have some ad-hoc reporting requests need to be handled from time to time, sometime it's urgent sometime it's not but it would be great if I could receive reporting within that day.

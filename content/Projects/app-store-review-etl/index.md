_app-store-review-etl_ is a Python app to fetch app reviews, generate review analysis and provide report with a Google Sheet.

This app leverages Google Gemini AI model to summarize top liked and disliked features, using VADER, WordCloud and matplotlib library for sentiment analysis and data visualization.

Get your API keys üîë ready, then you could analyze app reviews üìä easily.

## Description

As a python programmer with product management and marketing work experience in the past, I am fascinated by automation tools ‚öôÔ∏è that facilitate work efficiency üöÄ and drive better customer experience üòÉ.

In 2024, AI productivity tool is not a dream anymore. Both OpenAI and Google provide LLM models for developers to build AI products.

Thus, the highlight of this app is that I used Google Gemini model to generate AI-wise app review analysis.
Besides, I chose Google Sheet as a database for flexibility and scalability, then you could use the output Google Sheet as data source for further data visualization with Looker or Tableau.

## Features

- üíæ Fetch App Reviews
